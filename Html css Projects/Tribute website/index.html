          <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27
            July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who
            served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised
            in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and
            aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist
            and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts. He was
            known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development
            of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a
            pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the second test since the first
            nuclear test by India in 1974.
